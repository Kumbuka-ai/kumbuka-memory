/**
 * R8 — the acting identity is the token's subject, and the audience is
 * checked; the service does not start otherwise.
 *
 * <h2>Why this matters more here than in a service that only records an author</h2>
 *
 * The principal is written into {@code owner_subject} AND compared against it
 * on every read of a private entry. An unpinned principal therefore does not
 * merely record the wrong name: it makes the owner check compare two different
 * kinds of name, so the write succeeds, the read returns nothing, and the
 * whole thing reads as missing data.
 *
 * <p>The core carries the same guard because the pin shipped mis-pathed once
 * and nothing noticed until somebody looked at a row.
 *
 * <h2>Why the shipped file is read as well</h2>
 *
 * The test profile disables the bearer tenant, so the guard stands down when
 * the suite boots and the shipped values are never exercised by it. Reading
 * the artefact is what closes that gap: the running configuration cannot
 * answer a question about the file a deployment ships.
