/**
 * A guard on what a log line may carry.
 *
 * <p>The convention says: address, selector, number, transition, status, typed
 * reason, duration, scope id — and never a title, a text, metadata, a token, a
 * receipt or the actor. For this service that means at least: never the
 * content of an entry, never its reference, never a conflict token, never the
 * actor. Without something that runs, that sentence is a request.
 *
 * <h2>What this guard does not decide</h2>
 *
 * An address of this service carries a key its caller chose. Whether that key,
 * or the address holding it, may appear in a log line is not decided. The
 * guard therefore neither refuses it nor lists it among the permitted shapes;
 * the permitted fixture leaves it out on purpose.
 *
 * <h2>Why it matters more than it looks</h2>
 *
 * The operator boundary of this service is built as a missing GRANT: there is
 * no privilege that would let the provider read an entry. A log line
 * carrying its content walks around that entirely — the log leaves the container
 * by a different road, and a shipper collecting it delivers exactly the
 * content the database refuses to hand over. The guarantee would still be true
 * of the database and false of the deployment.
 *
 * <p>The actor is excluded for a different reason. It belongs in the audit
 * log, whose collection is governed and whose purpose is to record who changed
 * what. A second, aggregatable stream of the same fact, kept somewhere with
 * different rules, is how not-collecting-behavioural-data gets circumvented
 * without anybody deciding to circumvent it. Correlation runs through a
 * request id.
 *
 * <h2>Identifiers, not substrings</h2>
 *
 * A forbidden thing is looked for as an identifier written in the source, and
 * the identifier is compared by the words it is made of. A search for
 * substrings catches every longer word that happens to contain one: the actor
 * looked for as {@code ctor} reports {@code selector} as carrying the actor,
 * and the selector is on the permitted list. This was measured in the sibling
 * service this guard is copied from.
 *
 * <p>Comparing words rather than whole identifiers is what keeps the reach the
 * substring version had. {@code subjectId} and {@code getTitle} still fall,
 * because {@code subject} and {@code title} are words inside them.
 * {@code selector} and {@code somebody} do not, because {@code actor} and
 * {@code body} are not words inside them — only letters.
 *
 * <h2>The cardinality trap</h2>
 *
 * A guard that walks a tree and finds no log calls passes. It also passes when
 * the logging was deleted, when the pattern stopped matching, and when it is
 * pointed at the wrong directory. So this asserts a minimum count as well: the
 * check must have had something to check. That applies to the permitted
 * fixture too — a green result over an empty directory says nothing.
